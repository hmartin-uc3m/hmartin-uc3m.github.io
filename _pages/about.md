I am an Associate Professor at University Carlos III of Madrid working on  hardware security and trust. My main research interests are:

1. **Random Number Generators**: True Random Number Generators; Pseudo Random Number Generators; Quantum Random Number Generators; Stocastic Model; Min-Entropy; On-line tests; Secure FPGA Implementations; AIS20/31; NIST 800-90A/B/C; Attacks against RNGs.
2. **Physical Unclonable Functions**: Design and Evaluation; Reliability Enhancement; Mutual Authentication Protocols based on PUFs; Effects of Ionizing Radiation on PUFs; PUF database and test platform; ML IP protection based on PUFs.
3. **Other topics related to Hardware Security**: Hardware Trojans; Fault attacks and Countermeasures; Secure-by-design Implemenations; Formal Verification; Approximate Computing; Post-Quantum Cryptography; Composability;
