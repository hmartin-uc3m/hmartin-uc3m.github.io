    abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions an autonomous network between everyday objects to create real-life services. This enables new applications that necessarily require a high level of security and privacy. In this paper,
     we present PIONEER---a Prototype for the Internet of Things based on an Extendable EPC Gen2 RFID tag. It is the first prototype that integrates the Internet Protocol Security suite (IPsec) into the new EPC Gen2 Version 2 standard. Furthermore,
     it integrates all mandatory cryptographic primitives to support IPsec on an RFID tag,
     i.e.,
     AES-128 for encryption/decryption,
     192-bit Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) for key agreement,
     and a True Random Number Generator (TRNG). To keep the flexibility high,
     we further integrated an 8-bit microcontroller that implements the new security features of the EPC Gen2 standard in C code. The entire design was synthesized for a 130 nm CMOS process technology. It requires about 52 kGEs including all necessary components to establish a secure IPsec tunnel between the RFID tag and a client on the Internet. The prototype is fully compliant with already existing Internet and RFID standards and allows first cost estimations for a practical realization of high-security IoT applications.",

**Abstract:**

   In the last years there has been a considerable growth on the number of users in on-line banking (Szopinski, 2016). Banks must implement strong security solutions and users have to feel safe about the security offered. To securize the users’ access, virtual keyboards are commonly used. Unlikely, virtual keyboards are vulnerable to shoulder surfing and malicious software-based attacks such as malware and Trojans (Nadkarni et al., 2011; Sapra et al., 2013). In this article we propose a Hardware Trojan (HT), which targets a VGA display and is able to reveal the private information clicked by the user on a virtual keyboard. This HT is very harmful since it defeats the countermeasures (e.g., keyboard mutation or obfuscation) generally used to combat malicious pieces of software (Nayak et al., 2014; Parekh et al., 2011; Rajarajan et al., 2014).

**Abstract:**

   Legitimate identification of devices is crucial to ensure the security of present and future IoT ecosystems. In this regard, AI-based systems that exploit intrinsic hardware variations have gained notable relevance. Within this context, on-chip sensors included for monitoring purposes in a wide range of SoCs remain almost unexplored, despite their potential as a valuable source of both information and variability. In this work, we introduce and release a dataset comprising data collected from the on-chip temperature and voltage sensors of 20 microcontroller-based boards from the STM32L family. These boards were stimulated with five different algorithms, as workloads to elicit diverse responses. The dataset consists of five acquisitions (1.3 billion readouts) that are spaced over time and were obtained under different configurations using an automated platform. The raw dataset is publicly available, along with metadata and scripts developed to generate pre-processed T–V sequence sets. Finally, a proof of concept consisting of training a simple model is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the identification system based on these data.

**Abstract:**

   Over the last decade, technological advances in smart grids have permitted the modernization of legacy electricity networks. As Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart grids are becoming an efficient response to managing changing electric demand, the heterogeneous network of equipment required to make these Cyber-Physical Systems a reality poses some security threats. This paper proposes a novel mutual authentication and key agreement scheme to ensure communications security and protect users’ privacy in smart grid applications. In the proposed scheme (named EPSG), an elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) module and a physical unclonable function (PUF) are used simultaneously to provide acceptable confidentiality and integrity levels. The security analysis demonstrates that the EPSG has a robust security posture regarding transferred messages on the communication channel and physical attacks. In addition, EPSG is resistant to modeling attacks as one of the main vulnerabilities of PUF modules. Furthermore, by implementing the EPSG on an Arduino UNO microcontroller, a comparative performance evaluation (e.g., Time 156 ms, Communication cost 1408 bits, and Energy consumption 13.728 mJ) demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed EPSG.

**Abstract:**

   Recently, using Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) to design lightweight authentication protocols for constrained environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT) has received much attention. In this direction, Barbareschi et al. recently proposed PHEMAP in Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, a PUF based mutual authentication protocol. Also, they extended it to the later designed Salted PHEMAP, for low-cost cloud-edge (CE) IoT devices. This paper presents the first third-party security analysis of PHEMAP and Salted PHEMAP to the best of our knowledge. Despite the designer's claim, we show that these protocols are vulnerable to impersonation, de-synchronization, and traceability attacks. The success probability of the proposed attacks is ‘1’, while the complexity is negligible. In addition, we introduce two enhanced lightweight authentication protocols based on PUF chains (called PBAP and Salted PBAP), using the same design principles as PHEMAP and Salted PHEMAP. With the performance evaluation and the security analysis, it is justified that the two proposed schemes are practically well suited for use in resource-constrained IoT environments.

**Abstract:**

   Large-scale parameter characterization of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) is of paramount importance in order to assess the quality and thus the suitability of such PUFs which would then be developed as an industrial-grade solution for hardware root of trust. Carrying out a proper characterization requires a large number of devices that need to be repeatedly sampled at various conditions. These prerequisites make PUF characterization process a very time-consuming and expensive task. Our work presents a dataset for the study of SRAM-based PUFs on microcontrollers; it includes full SRAM readouts along with internal voltage and temperature sensors of 84 microcontrollers of STM32 type. Data has been gathered with a custom-made and open platform designed for the automatic acquisition of SRAM readouts of such devices. This platform also provides possibilities of experimenting aging and reliability properties.

**Abstract:**

   This work studies the impact that the architectural choices can have in the error mitigation of a digital processing module such as the Fast Fourier Transform. To this purpose, several serial and pipelined architectures were implemented in FPGA using Block Triple Modular Redundancy and analysed under a fault injection approach that was previously validated with radiation. These architectures were compared with respect to error rate, common mode failure rate and signal-to-noise ratio. Experimental results show that the error rate is strongly correlated with the use of resources when using a similar architecture. However, pipelined architectures tend to have more common mode failures but with lower signal-to-noise ratio than a serial architecture.

To this purpose, several serial and pipelined architectures were implemented in FPGA using Block Triple Modular Redundancy and analysed under a fault injection approach that was previously validated with radiation. These architectures were compared with respect to error rate, common mode failure rate and signal-to-noise ratio. Experimental results show that the error rate is strongly correlated with the use of resources when using a similar architecture.

**Abstract:**

   Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are a cryptographic primitive that exploit the unique physical characteristics of Integrated Circuits (ICs). A PUF can be modeled as a black-box challenge–response system. The number and size of challenge–response pairs (CRPs) supported by a PUF determine and condition its strength. Ring Oscillators (RO)-based PUF, which are one of the most implemented on FPGA, suffer from a low number and size of CRPs. In this work, we propose an innovative mechanism to expand the size of the CRPs in a RO-PUF by using multiple bits of the two ROs under comparison. To satisfy the reliability and enhance the quality of these responses, we either switch the remaining ROs that are not used for the comparison off or use them as a background noise. We validated our proposal using FPGA measurements. The results show that, with the same number of Ring Oscillators, the CRP size can be doubled with a minimum area overhead.

**Abstract:**

   Today, medical equipment or general-purpose devices such as smart-watches or smart-textiles can acquire a person’s vital signs. Regardless of the type of device and its purpose, they are all equipped with one or more sensors and often have wireless connectivity. Due to the transmission of sensitive data through the insecure radio channel and the need to ensure exclusive access to authorised entities, security mechanisms and cryptographic primitives must be incorporated onboard these devices. Random number generators are one such necessary cryptographic primitive. Motivated by this, we propose a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) that makes use of the GSR signal measured by a sensor on the body. After an exhaustive analysis of both the entropy source and the randomness of the output, we can conclude that the output generated by the proposed TRNG behaves as that produced by a random variable. Besides, and in comparison with the previous proposals, the performance offered is much higher than that of the earlier works.

**Abstract:**

   Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are hardware security primitives that are increasingly being used for authentication and key generation in ICs and FPGAs. For space systems, they are a promising approach to meet the needs for secure communications at low cost. To this purpose, it is essential to determine if they are reliable in the space radiation environment. In this work we evaluate the Total Ionizing Dose effects on a delay-based PUF implemented in SRAM-FPGA, namely a Ring Oscillator PUF. Several major quality metrics have been used to analyze the evolution of the PUF response with the total ionizing dose. Experimental results demonstrate that total ionizing dose has a perceptible effect on the quality of the PUF response, but it could still be used for space applications by making some appropriate corrections.

**Abstract:**

   Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are a promising technology with applications in many areas such as environment monitoring, agriculture, the military field or health-care, to name but a few. Unfortunately, the wireless connectivity of the sensors opens doors to many security threats, and therefore, cryptographic solutions must be included on-board these devices and preferably in their design phase. In this vein, Random Number Generators (RNGs) play a critical role in security solutions such as authentication protocols or key-generation algorithms. In this article is proposed an avant-garde proposal based on the cardiac signal generator we carry with us (our heart), which can be recorded with medical or even low-cost sensors with wireless connectivity. In particular, for the extraction of random bits, a multi-level decomposition has been performed by wavelet analysis. The proposal has been tested with one of the largest and most publicly available datasets of electrocardiogram signals (202 subjects and 24 h of recording time). Regarding the assessment, the proposed True Random Number Generator (TRNG) has been tested with the most demanding batteries of statistical tests (ENT, DIEHARDERand NIST), and this has been completed with a bias, distinctiveness and performance analysis. From the analysis conducted, it can be concluded that the output stream of our proposed TRNG behaves as a random variable and is suitable for securing WSNs.

**Abstract:**

   The effects of ionizing radiation on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been investigated in depth during the last decades. The impact of these effects is typically evaluated on implementations which have a deterministic behavior. In this article, two well-known true-random number generators (TRNGs) based on sampling jittery signals have been exposed to a Co-60 radiation source as in the standard tests for space conditions. The effects of the accumulated dose on these TRNGs, an in particular, its repercussion over their randomness quality (e.g., entropy or linear complexity), have been evaluated by using two National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) statistical test suites. The obtained results clearly show how the degradation of the statistical properties of these TRNGs increases with the accumulated dose. It is also notable that the deterioration of the TRNG (non-deterministic component) appears before that the degradation of the deterministic elements in the FPGA, which compromises the integrated circuit lifetime.
